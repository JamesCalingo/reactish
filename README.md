# blog
A personally designed blog from the ground up

# What it is
Using the power of JavaScript, this is a personal blog set up as a single page application.

"So...React?"

Nope! This is...Reactish.

Yeah, I know that name isn't very good, but it's the best way for me to describe what's going on here. Instead of using React's library to build components such as posts and the like, I've made my own component library using basic Javascript (with a hint of JSX).

# Using
Literally just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript made to resemble a framework like React or Angular.
